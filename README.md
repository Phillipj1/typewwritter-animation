//$w.onReady(function () { ... });: 
This code is executed when the Wix page is fully loaded and ready. It encapsulates the entire functionality.
const TEXT = "Hello, I'm your virtual assistant How may I help you today?";: This line defines the text you want to display as the virtual assistant's message.
let typewrittenText = " ";: It initializes an empty string typewrittenText that will be used to build the typewritten message character by character.
const textArray = Array.from(TEXT);: This line converts the TEXT string into an array of individual characters. Each character will be typed out one by one.
textArray.forEach((char, index) => { ... });: This loop iterates over each character in textArray and defines a setTimeout function for each character.
setTimeout(() => { ... }, 100 * index);: This code sets a timeout for each character, causing it to be added to typewrittenText with a delay. The delay is calculated as 100 milliseconds multiplied by the character's index in the textArray. This creates a typewriter effect with characters appearing one after another.
typewrittenText += char;: Within the setTimeout callback, this line adds the current character to the typewrittenText string.
$w("#typewritter").text = typewrittenText;: This line updates the text content of an element with the ID "typewritter" (likely an HTML element) to display the 
typewrittenText. It effectively simulates typing the message on the webpage.
console.log(textArray);: This line logs the textArray to the console, which can be useful for debugging purposes to see the individual characters.
